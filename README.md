# DIY PAPR

### What is a PAPR?

A PAPR is a positive air pressure respirator that works by supplying clean air to the user in such a way that more air is supplied than is used so external contaminants don't get in.
They're particulalrly useful in the case of smoke or contagions as all the input air is heavily filtered before being delivered to the user.

But most are quite expensive so we wanted to design our own!

This repo contains all of the files you need to recreate our design and adapt it to work with many types of commercially availiable filters and helmets. 

V3 is the most up to date and functional version. V4 is still under development.
